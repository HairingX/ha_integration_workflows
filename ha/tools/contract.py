"""What every integration's repository promises, checked against the installed environment.

    contract.py ROOT     checks the repository at ROOT, with the tests' packages installed, and
                         fails with one error per broken promise

The promises: the manifest says 0.0.0, as the version lives in the release's tag and zip; HACS
installs a zip named after the domain and requires the Home Assistant the tests run; every
requirement is one Home Assistant accepts, by hassfest's rules for a custom integration, pinned
with == where those rules allow, run by the tests and pinned in requirements-test.txt; the quality
scale states every rule; and every translation holds the same keys.
