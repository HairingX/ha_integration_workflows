"""What every library's repository promises.

    library_contract.py ROOT    checks the repository at ROOT and fails with one error per

The promises: the version is worked out from the release's tag when the package is built, never
written in a file; the package ships its types; it supports the Python versions the tests run;
the test tools are pinned with ==, coverage among them; and pyright is strict and the tests cover
every line, unless a transition says why not yet.
